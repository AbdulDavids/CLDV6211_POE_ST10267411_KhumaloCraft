        <h2>Our Founder's Vision</h2>
        <p><strong>James Khumalo</strong>, our founder, grew up immersed in the rich tapestry of cultural heritage and artisanal craftsmanship of his hometown. Fascinated by the stories each handmade item told, James envisioned a space where these stories could be shared and celebrated on a global scale. With a background in technology and a heart deeply rooted in community and culture, James has steered KhumaloCraft to become a platform that showcases handcrafted goods and fosters direct connections between artisans and the global community.</p>
